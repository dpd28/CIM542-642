## Week 1

### Unicorn Closet

This is the Unicorn of closets. It will help you pack, get you dressed, Marie Kondo your way to savings because you really don't love those black pants anymore. For the purpose of this assignment, I focused on how this magical closet helps you pack your suitcase or any bag. Based on your inputs (screen-based) it will help select your clothes and if needed, give you room to do some shopping.

Thinking, thinking, thinking â€¦ I used to feel like I needed to draw as a designer but I'm finding that words are just as useful.

So this closet uses a screen interaction which probably doesn't fit the physical computing aspect of the project but I thought about inputs and outputs just the same.  The interactions are also based on having geolocation and other "auto" features to make the inputs easier (read: minimal touching, typing, etc.)

I didn't think too much about how the clothes get into the suitcase (because its magic) but that would be a big next step if I ever wanted to make this a reality.

My favorite part about this magical closet (I'm allowed to love my idea, right?) is that it provides you with a printout (or a digital note) of how to mix and match the items it has packed for you.


## Week 2

### Arduino Space Ship

OK, this was fun. I did have some issues:
* In the code, I had a capital "I" on my "if"
* The power wire from the switch to the Arduino was in the wrong pin

That took me awhile to figure out but I did - yay me.
