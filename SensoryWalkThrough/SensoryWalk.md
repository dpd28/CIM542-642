# Sensory Walk: University of Miami, Coral Gables campus

I chose to track and observe people as I walked around campus and during activities. One interaction was done at my apartment building. The number of interactions are many so I chose to focus on physical interactions since screen-based interaction are difficult to observe from a distance. Most of the interactions are active and provide visible or auditory feedback.

## Microwave
